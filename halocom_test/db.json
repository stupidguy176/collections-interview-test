      "story_text": "I&#x27;m a 24 y&#x2F;o full stack engineer (I know some of you are rolling your eyes right now, just highlighting that I have experience on frontend apps as well as backend architecture). I&#x27;ve been working professionally for ~7 years building mostly javascript projects but also some PHP. Two years ago I was diagnosed with a condition called &quot;Usher&#x27;s Syndrome&quot; - characterized by hearing loss, balance issues, and progressive vision loss.<p>I know there are blind software engineers out there. My main questions are:<p>- Are there blind frontend engineers?<p>- What kinds of software engineering lend themselves to someone with limited vision? Backend only?<p>- Besides a screen reader, what are some of the best tools for building software with limited vision?<p>- Does your company employ blind engineers? How well does it work? What kind of engineer are they?<p>I&#x27;m really trying to get ahead of this thing and prepare myself as my vision is degrading rather quickly. I&#x27;m not sure what I can do if I can&#x27;t do SE as I don&#x27;t have any formal education in anything. I&#x27;ve worked really hard to get to where I am and don&#x27;t want it to go to waste.<p>Thank you for any input, and stay safe out there!<p>Edit:<p>Thank you all for your links, suggestions, and moral support, I really appreciate it. Since my diagnosis I&#x27;ve slowly developed a crippling anxiety centered around a feeling that I need to figure out the rest of my life before it&#x27;s too late. I know I shouldn&#x27;t think this way but it is hard not to. I&#x27;m very independent and I feel a pressure to &quot;show up.&quot; I will look into these opportunities mentioned and try to get in touch with some more members of the blind engineering community.",

          "value": "I'm a 24 y/o full stack engineer (I know some of you are rolling your eyes right now, just highlighting that I have experience on frontend apps as well as backend architecture). I've been working professionally for ~7 years building mostly javascript projects but also some PHP. Two years ago I was diagnosed with a condition called &quot;Usher's Syndrome&quot; - characterized by hearing loss, balance issues, and progressive vision loss.<p>I know there are blind software engineers out there. My main questions are:<p>- Are there blind frontend engineers?<p>- What kinds of software engineering lend themselves to someone with limited vision? Backend only?<p>- Besides a screen reader, what are some of the best tools for building software with limited vision?<p>- Does your company employ blind engineers? How well does it work? What kind of engineer are they?<p>I'm really trying to get ahead of this thing and prepare myself as my vision is degrading rather quickly. I'm not sure what I can do if I can't do SE as I don't have any formal education in anything. I've worked really hard to get to where I am and don't want it to go to waste.<p>Thank you for any input, and stay safe out there!<p>Edit:<p>Thank you all for your links, suggestions, and moral support, I really appreciate it. Since my diagnosis I've slowly developed a crippling anxiety centered around a feeling that I need to figure out the rest of my life before it's too late. I know I shouldn't think this way but it is hard not to. I'm very independent and I feel a pressure to &quot;show up.&quot; I will look into these opportunities mentioned and try to get in touch with some more members of the blind engineering community.",

I then decided to contact HN to ask how can I get more traction to my projects and they told me about the Show HN, a tag design to share small and even unfinished projects.

I already had a lot of things done when I decided to upload them to GitHub.

It&#x27;s been really cool so far and I have a huge appreciation for  Hackernews and the good people that work here. They provide a cool platform where people can share relevant news. They provide tools for people to start their own startup. They share job openings. They share companies that are hiring. It&#x27;s a neat place for programmers, hackers and tech enthusiasts in general. I wrote this cause you never know when your story will inspire others and maybe there&#x27;s someone on the struggle right now looking for a job. This was my experience.

An &#x27;unvote&#x27; or &#x27;undown&#x27; link appears after a post&#x27;s timestamp when you vote.<p>3. Save and share the best stories and comments. Click on a post&#x27;s timestamp to go to its page, then click &#x27;favorite&#x27; at the top. Your favorites are linked from your profile, and you can browse other users&#x27; from theirs.<p>4. On the front page and &#x2F;newest, click &#x27;hide&#x27; if you no longer want to see a story. The next story in the list will slide up at the bottom. If you change your mind, visit &#x2F;hidden and click &#x27;unhide&#x27;. If you&#x27;re logged in, hidden stories persist for a week.<p>5. Find out which stories were the most popular on HN on a given day by visiting &#x2F;front?day=yyyy-mm-dd. You&#x27;ll see all the front page stories for that day, sorted by how much time they spent there. For example, Alan Kay&#x27;s AMA had the most front page time on June 20: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;front?day=2016-06-20.<p>Finally, I&#x27;m pleased to introduce sctb, a.k.a. Scott Bell, as a Hacker News moderator. Scott has been moderating HN incognito for a long time, but starting today he and I will be sharing the public part of the job. Since Scott is familiar with all aspects of HN moderation, you shouldn&#x27;t notice any changes in practice; this is just an internal refactoring to enable such innovations as vacations and a day off. Scott is my cofounder from Skysheet (YC W09), an excellent programmer with a meticulous eye for detail, and a thoroughly decent human being. Please welcome him and be nice!",
